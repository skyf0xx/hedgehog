## Delegating on this host

The agents in `.claude/agents/` are registered automatically — delegate to
one by name (`backend-eng`, `reviewer`, and so on) and it runs in its own
context with its own tool grant. The skills in `.claude/skills/` are
available the same way; invoke one by name rather than reimplementing what
it describes.

Clear context with `/clear` at the unit boundaries the
`hedgehog-orchestrating` skill states.
